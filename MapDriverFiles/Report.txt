Cody Carlson, Vincent Loignon, James Potvin, Robert Hacker

INSTALLATION/COMPILATION:

1. Run 'make'

2. Run 'make test'
3. Run 'make socket-test'

Running for part 3:
1. Run ./mapserverg.exe
2. Run ./mapclientg.exe
3. Run make kill-children

CURRENTLY KNOWN BUGS:
- Error messages occaisonally have 0s in them that were not placed there (Particularly at the end)
- mapclientg children begin to write message but never finish for some reason.
  We think it might be due to reentrant stuff.
