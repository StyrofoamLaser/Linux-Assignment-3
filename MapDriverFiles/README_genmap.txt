README FOR genmap.sh

Running "./genmap.sh" -- with no args -- will generate a random ASCII-map of size 50x50. 

It will keep trying until it is 'valid' meaning there are less than 50% white spaces. If it fails 10 times, the program will exit and print to STDERR.

Running with 1 arg sets the maps width -- "./genmap.sh 25" -- will be a 25x50.

Running with 2 args sets the maps width and height -- "./genmap.sh 25 25" -- will be a 25x25.

Good luck, ask me any questions you have!
